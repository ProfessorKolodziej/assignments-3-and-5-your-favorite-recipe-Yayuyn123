	<h1>Vegan Apple Fritters</h1>
		<p>Apple Fritters are easy to make at home in 30 minutes or less with NO yeast! These crunchy, sweet donuts are vegan but no one would guess it. Full of fresh apples!</p>

		<p>There are a few things you will need to safely make fried apple fritters at home:</p>
		<p>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/2MMRfeJ">Food thermometer</a> - This is a very inexpensive kitchen tool that you really need if you want to fry anything. The oil needs to be hot enough, but not too hot, so a thermometer is essential.</p> 
		<p>2. A <a href="https://amzn.to/2LjHUe3">large pot</a> or skillet for frying. I like a deep pot when frying instead of a shallow skillet.</p>
	
		<h2>Ingredients you need</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All purpose flour - I haven't tried them with another flour. A gluten free mix might work, if you try it let me know in the comments.</li>
			<li>Granulated sugar</li>
			<li>Baking powder</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>Unsweetened applesauce - A perfect egg replacer in donut recipes, and so easy!</li>
			<li>Soy milk - You can use another plant milk, like almond or cashew.</li>
			<li>Apples - Use a crisp apple, like granny smith or honey crisp. Honey crisp is my favorite apple to use here!</li>
			<li>Oil for frying - Make sure to use a high smoke point oil for frying, like peanut, vegetable or canola oil.</li>
			<li>Powdered sugar - For making the glaze.</li>
			<li>Vanilla</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to make apple fritters</h2>
		<ol><li>In a large bowl, add 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon. Stir to combine.</li>
			<li>Now add 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup soy milk to the bowl and mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix.</li>
			<li>Add the diced 2 apples and fold them in. I like a LOT of apples!</li>
			<li>Heat 2-3 inches of oil (to 375â„‰) in a deep pot or skillet. Scoop about 1/3 cup of the fritter dough and place in the hot oil, spreading it out a bit. They will puff up as they cook.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>TIPS: You can also place 1/3 cup of the dough on a floured surface, and using floured hands, press it down to flatten before using a spatula to carefully transfer it to the hot oil.</p>
		<p>Cook 2-3 fritters at a time for 2-3 minutes on one side (maybe less, so watch carefully) until golden brown, then flip using tongs and cook for 1-2 more minutes until both sides are brown, but not burnt.</p>
